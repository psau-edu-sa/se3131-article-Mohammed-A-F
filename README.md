- [How to Prepare for IT Job Market](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ufEXSHDRsHYPqYYL6UnzpEDBe5CEC-J0/view?usp=sharing)  is the first article I've worked on; it talks about preparing your self for the IT job market before you enter it.

- [Traffic Light No.1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jd799WGJDMDS9gsX4D6H5l909BG9b_nO/view?usp=share_link) 
 is a presentation for a homework we had; it's a system that describe a traffic light in Petri Net (I worked in it with a group, also this is the first try; it has a small problem that we've fixed in the second try).

- [Traffic Light No.2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NByOvRyhDZ8jHLLYqy9rxNwZCqY5_NJV/view?usp=share_link)
 is the second try, we have fixed some problems on the system.
    >I will insert the files for the petri net we have worked on for both of the tries.
